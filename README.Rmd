# WebCMap

<!-- badges: start -->

WebCMap is a highly efficient platform designed for query extended CMap, renowned for its ultra-fast computation speed and minimal resource consumption. It aims to provide users with a convenient and reliable solution for connectivity map analysis. Its main features and objectives include:

1.Blazing-Fast Computation: Leveraging advanced algorithm optimization and an efficient computational architecture, WebCMap achieves fast responses in comparing and analyzing large-scale signature data, significantly enhancing research efficiency and saving users' time.

2.Low Resource Requirements: The platform is designed with a focus on optimizing computational resources, ensuring smooth operation even on standard hardware configurations, thereby lowering user barriers and hardware costs.

3.Accurate Connectivity Analysis: Users can upload query signatures (query signatures) and efficiently compare them with extended CMap. Six kinds of connectivity scores are computed to accurately identify candidate signatures that are positively or negatively correlated with the query signature.

4.Diverse Application Scenarios: The platform is suitable for various fields, including drug repurposing, disease mechanism research, and biomarker discovery, helping researchers quickly screen potential drug candidates and similar drug/toxic/compound searching.

## Installation

You can install the development version of WebCMap like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(WebCMap)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
